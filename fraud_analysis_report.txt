Cross-Bank Fraud Analysis Report
Date: 2025-06-23

I. Analysis Overview
--------------------
This report details the findings from an investigation into cross-bank fraud activities 
centered around a compromised device (91b12379-8...) and user account 
(0007f26556...). The analysis involved:

1. Data enrichment of IP and User Agent information
2. Network graph construction of device-user relationships
3. Identification of connected fraudulent entities
4. Visualization of the fraud network

Key Statistics:
- Total devices analyzed: 169
- Total user accounts: 333
- Total IP subnets: 145
- Accounts linked to compromised device: 332
- Devices linked to compromised account: 167

II. Key Findings
----------------
A. Compromised Account Details:
   - Bank: Bank8
   - Associated devices: 167

B. Fraud Connection Patterns:
   - The fraud network spans 641 entities (167 devices, 332 users, 142 subnets)
   - Connections were established through:
        * Direct device-user usage
        * Shared device fingerprints
        * Identical device profiles
        * Common IP subnets

C. Device Profile Analysis:
   The most common device profiles in the fraud network:
       1. Android_Chrome_(780, 360, 24) (416 occurrences)
       2. Android_Chrome_(960, 600, 24) (242 occurrences)
       3. Mac_Chrome_(1440, 900, 24) (212 occurrences)

D. Location Analysis:
   The most frequently used IP subnets:
       1. 176.59.32.0/20 (259 devices)
       2. 109.197.204.0/22 (206 devices)
       3. 185.97.200.0/22 (79 devices)

III. Recommendations
--------------------
1. Immediate blocking of high-risk subnets:
   - 176.59.32.0/20
   - 109.197.204.0/22

2. Enhanced monitoring for devices matching common profiles:
   - Profile: Android_Chrome_(780, 360, 24)
   - Profile: Android_Chrome_(960, 600, 24)

3. Cross-bank coordination for accounts:
   - 0007f26556... (Bank Bank8)

IV. Visual Evidence
-------------------
The fraud network visualization shows:
   - the Red squares: Device nodes (each DEV:<device_id>) With Country, City, OS and Browser
   - the blue circles: User nodes (each USR:<identity>) With Country, City, OS and Browser
   - An edge between a square and a circle indicates a “logged_in” relation (i.e., that device accessed that user account)

See attached fraud_network.html for interactive visualization.

Conclusion
----------
The analysis revealed a coordinated fraud operation using 167 devices across 1 banks. 
The operation shows sophisticated use of device spoofing techniques and IP rotation.
